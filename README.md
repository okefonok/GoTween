## 🛠️ Using GoTween

Once you have imported GoTween into your Godot project, you can start creating animations within your scenes. Here’s a simple example to animate a sprite:

1. **Attach a Script** to the Sprite node.
2. **Call GoTween Functions** in the script:
   ```gdscript
   func _ready():
       GoTween.to($Sprite, 2, {"position": Vector2(400, 300), "ease": "ease_in_out"})
   ```

This will move your sprite to the coordinates (400, 300) over two seconds with a smooth easing effect.
